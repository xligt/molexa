MOLEXA is a deep generative neural network capable of reconstructing molecular geometries from ion momentum measurements in X-ray-based Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) experiments. It is built on the Transformer architecture and the diffusion generative modeling framework. It allows for inversion of momentum-space datasets to position space, thus providing the structure of a molecule right before its interaction with an X-ray pulse. In addition, it can provide an uncertainty estimate for its reconstructed molecular geometries. By employing time-resolved CEI datasets, MOLEXA is able to provide ”snapshots” of a molecule at different instants during a chemical reaction. This enables the use of the CEI technique for direct reconstruction of molecular dynamics as they unfold on femtosecond or longer time scales.
