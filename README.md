MOLEXA is a deep generative neural network capable of reconstructing molecular geometries from ion momentum measurements in X-ray-based Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) experiments. It is built on the Transformer architecture and the diffusion generative modeling framework. It allows for inversion of momentum-space datasets to position space, thus providing the structure of a molecule right before its interaction with an X-ray pulse. In addition, it can provide an uncertainty estimate for its reconstructed molecular geometries. By employing time-resolved CEI datasets, MOLEXA is able to provide ”snapshots” of a molecule at different instants during a chemical reaction. This enables the use of the CEI technique for direct reconstruction of molecular dynamics as they unfold on femtosecond or longer time scales.  

  
Its main architecture is illustrated below.
